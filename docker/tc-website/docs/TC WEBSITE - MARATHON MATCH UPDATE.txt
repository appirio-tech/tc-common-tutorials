Docker Images
=====================

The appiriodevops/tc-website:base image is not changed, so instead of building your own(there is error for downloading jdk, see https://apps.topcoder.com/forums//?module=Thread&threadID=901970&start=0),
you can directly pull the existing base image from docker repo:
docker pull appiriodevops/tc-website:base

The other 3 images (appiriodevops/tc-website:build, appiriodevops/tc-website:run and appiriodevops/tc-website:httpd) are changed and need be rebuilt.

Refer to README.md for details to build and run docker images.
